Water Pump Inverter

If you have this type of inverter and would like to control it with an ESP, you can do so using the attached circuit and configuration. 
There are two important settings: 
P43 Relay output, change it from 0 to 1
P11 Start stop control source, change it from 0 to 2 !!! Warning !!! From this point on, the start/stop buttons on the device controller will no longer work.

My Inverter settings:
| Prog  | Value |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| P07  | 33  |
| P11  | 2  |
| P11  | 2  |
| P25  | 2  |
| P30  | 43500  |
| P39  | 3000  |
